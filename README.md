# Flight-Price-Prediction

This project is a price prediction model based on Classification and using Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit Learn Package.

1.EDA is performed for clear understanding and applied supervised ML algorithms like Random Forest and KNN.
2.The best model is predicted through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation and achieved an accuracy of 87%.
